						<h2>02/06/2022 - New Website Moment;</h2>
						<br>
						<div class="blogText">
							<p>Hello there! Now I know what you might be thinking "Bro what the fuck is this website? It looks like the <a href="https://archive.ph/a4rMr" id="yellow">Space Jam website</a>", and my response to that is you are wrong... it looks worse also they got rid of that website. It now redirects to the Warner Bros page for "Space Jam: A New Legacy". But I'm getting off topic.</p>
							<p>Yes, this website looks bad however it is much better I promise. But why I hear you ask well I will tell you, I think it is important for everyone to have their own website, not controlled by anyone but themselves and with that in mind for me, it makes no sense to have a website that is controlled by a company like Weebly. Now I'm not throwing any shade on Weebly, I'm just saying that I want to own my website not modify a restrictive template on a website. So I decided to create my own website with my own shit web design and my own email addresses (<a id="yellow">contact@sevengames.xyz</a>).</p>
							<p>So what is happening with 7Games, well now that much. I just finished my first year at college(i still got somethings to do but overall I'm done) which included making a game so I'm thinking after Ben Goes to Tesco: Ultimate comes out I'm going to look into polishing up that game and uploading it so that everyone can play it (not that I'm sure anyone would want to play it). Speaking about Ben Goes to Tesco: Ultimate how is it coming along? Well since around February this year I had to put BGTT:U onto the sideline as I focused on college more. However with college more or less over I can now get back to development. Now, which platforms is BGTT:U going to be released on? The Official List is:-<br>Windows<br><a href="../../interject.txt">Linux</a><br>HTML5</p>
							<p>When will it be released? <i id="yellow">Soon</i>. It is in the works I promise. So that is it for now, I hope you like the new website... or not like it, that's ok too. The original website is still up if you want to see it: <a href="https://7-games.weebly.com">https://7-games.weebly.com</a>. Remember to add my RSS feed the icon is on the footer. If you want to send an email my address is <a id="yellow">contact@sevengames.xyz</a>. If you want to encrypt a message to send to me or just have my public key for some reason here is my <a id="yellow" href="../../pgp.txt">PGP Key</a>.</p>
