						<h2>10/07/22 - I host Instances now!;</h2>
						<br>
						<div class="blogText">
							<p>You can read can't you? It's right up there if you can't tell. I now host public instances for several different project. But what is an Instance? Well in short when you go onto a site, for example let's say Reddit alot of information is being logged, on the official Reddit website your IP address, User-agent, Browser, Operating System, any referal links, the device ID, pages visited, links clicked, search terms, and more are being collected by a company that deletes anything that does not live up to the "Wholesome 100" look that they want.</p>
							<p>So let's say you want to use Reddit but don't want the Big Keanu Chungus Reeves company to know anything about you. Well then you are in luck. There are several projects such as Teddit and Libreddit that provides an "alternative front-end" to these sites and don't share you presonal information.<br>So I have some of these project and set them up so that anyone can use them. Of course these things cost money so if you like my instances why not <a id="yellow" href="../../donate.html">donate</a>? Yes I have a donation page no I don't care... I like money.</p>
							<h3>SearXNG;</h3>
							<p>SearXNG is a metasearch engine which basicly means it takes results from other search engines such as Google and DuckDuckGo and presents them to the user. On top of that it is also privacy-respecting, well as privacy-respecting as the search engines you have enabled are.<br><br>
								I think that metasearch engines are much better then normal search engines because some search engines do things much better than others so instead of having to go to different websites to get the link you want you can just use one site.<br>

								<a id="yellow">Link:</a> <a href="https://searx.sevengames.xyz">https://searx.sevengames.xyz</a><br></p>
							<br><br>
							<h3>Libreddit;</h3>
							<p>10 second pitch: Libreddit is a portmanteau of "libre" (meaning freedom) and "Reddit". It is a private front-end like <a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious">Invidious</a> but for Reddit. Browse the coldest takes of <a href="https://sevengames.xyz/r/unpopularopinion">r/unpopularopinion</a> without being <a href="https://github.com/spikecodes/libreddit#reddit">tracked</a>.<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>üöÄ Fast: written in Rust for blazing-fast speeds and memory safety</li><br>
								<li>‚òÅÔ∏è Light: no JavaScript, no ads, no tracking, no bloat</li><br>
								<li>üïµÔ∏è Private: all requests are proxied through the server, including media</li><br>
								<li>üîí Secure: strong Content Security Policy prevents browser requests to Reddit</li><br>
							</ul>
							</p><br>
							<p>Yes I did steal that directly from their GitHub repo.</p>

								<br><br>
							<h3>Invidious;</h3>
							<p>Invidious is an open source privacy-respecting alternative front-end to YouTube. If you've read the previous instances descriptions then you know what this is. It allows users to view YouTube videos without going to the YouTube site. Invidious is better than regluar YouTube not because is not owned by Google but because it is a lightweight site that just works... well and because it's not owned by Google.

							<br><br>
							<h3>Nitter;</h3>
							<p>Now reading the previous descriptions would you beleve if I told you that Nitter is an open source, fast, lightweight, privacy-respecting front-end for Twitter? You know the gist by now. Blah blah Twitter bad blah blah no JavaScript.</p>

							<p>As of right now those are all the instances I have running. Hopefully in the future I can have more running such as <a href="https://github.com/pablouser1/ProxiTok">ProxiTok</a> and <a href="https://sr.ht/~cadence/bibliogram/">Bibliogram</a>.<br><br>I'm going to write more Blogs in the future, right now I am thinking about OpenBSD. I used it for like a week and have some things to say about it.</p>
