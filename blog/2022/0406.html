						<h2>04/06/22 - Free Software (Free as in Freedom);</h2>
						<br>
						<div class="blogText">
							<p>Hello! Now when I say <a href="../../interject.txt">Linux</a> what is the first thing that comes to mind? Sweaty nerds? Angry elitists? Well, I see a group of dedicated people rallying around the idea of Free Software. Well OK fine I also see some sweaty nerds and angry elitiests too. When I say Free Software I don't mean free as in price (however the software is also free in price) but free as in Freedom meaning the software can be run, edited, contributed to, and freely shared.</p>
							<p>The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a non-profit founded by Richard Stallman in 1985, FSF's most know project is the GNU operating system used in tandem with the Linux Kernel to become GNU/Linux. If you look at software development over the years you can see that Open Source software has become more popular however Open Source and Free Software should not be confused with each other. An Open Source program can still be Proprietary. Take for example Microsoft Visual Studio Code, now in the past Microsoft has been harsh on Open Source software (going so far as to call Linux communism) however in 2015 Microsoft announced and released VS Code as an Open Source lightweight (compared to the normal visual studio) code editor, but did you read that? Open Source? and Microsoft? Impossible. Well, your wrong here is the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">VS Code GitHub page</a> (Microsoft owns GitHub... just to let you know). Ok well, that's all well and good, Microsoft released an Open Source program so what? Well if you go and download VS Code something might seem off. You see VS Code is licensed under the MIT Licence meaning anyone can use the code for commercial use, they can distribute it, or modify it. Ok, that's good, right? Anyone can do anything with the code. Well... most people just download the binaries from Microsoft's website however when Microsoft builds the binary the program is licensed under a Proprietary license. huh. Well, that's scummy. If VS Code was released under a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL</a> license then this would never happen (the GPL license was created by the Free Software Foundation).</p>
							<p>Ok, why should you care about Free Software? Well with Proprietary software you are giving up your freedom and possibly privacy if the company built any spyware into their software (or os). Ok, so what alternatives should you use instead of Proprietary software? Well just look them up yourself, but if you cannot be bothered here's some: instead of Microsoft Office use <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>, instead of Photoshop use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/"> GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)</a>, instead of using VLC use... well actually VLC is Free Software so its fine. If you wan't to look more into it here is a link to the <a href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki">Free Software Directory</a>.</p>
							<p>Now should you change your entire OS in the name of Free Software? I mean if you are that dedicated to Free Software then yes you should probably use something like GNU/Linux or maybe even OpenBSD. Now listen I'm not like some <a href="../../interject.txt">Linux</a> users, I'm not going to start yelling at you to "StARt UsiNg GNu+LinUX beCauSE WinDblOWS 11 SuXX aND is MAdE bY MiCro$OfT (akA SAtaN)" because believe it or not I have better things to do (surprisingly). And also to any people who are actually like that please watch <a href="../../res/memes/whateverylinuxuserneeds.mp4">this video</a>, it is very important. Ok let's get back on track, if you don't use <a href="../../interject.txt">Linux</a> or just haven't tried it then just look around at different distros for example maybe <a href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora Linux</a>, you don't even need to flash a USB and boot into it to try it out, you can make a Virtual Machine with <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a> or use <a href="https://distrotest.net/index.php">DistroTest.net</a>. Just give it a try... please :).</p>
