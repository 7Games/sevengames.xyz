						<h2>05/06/22 - The Onion Router;</h2>
						<br>
						<div class="blogText">
							<p>When you go to any website on the internet there is a very high chance that you are probably being tracked. By who? Everyone, mainly Big Tech e.g. Facebook, Google, and Amazon. Let's focus on Google, they are mainly an advertising company that sells user data. You may think that they might just sell what videos people watch on YouTube or people's Google search terms but it goes much deeper than that. Google allows people to have advertisements placed on their sites so the person can get profit, however, the advertisements can be used to track what website a user is on even if it is not owned by Google itself. But how can people stop Google from prying into their personal life more than that person wants? Well, many people point at VPNs which if you aren't as that pressed about privacy is a very good idea. However, the way to get a VPN is not so private, the best VPN that you could get if you are interested in keeping your privacy would probably be <a href="https://mullvad.net">Mullvad</a>, you don't need any personal information such as emails to create an account and payment is very secure, you can use <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> or just send in cash... like real money. You put it in an envelope along with a special code that is associated with your account then you send that envelope in the mail.</p>
							<p>So is Mullvad the best way to stay private online? No. It's not the absolute best way. It will still keep your IP address private if that's all you want but if you want however if you want to go beyond that then there is something far better than that. The Onion Router more commonly known as Tor (spelled as Tor, not TOR) uses a technique called Onion Routing where requests are encased in several layers of encryption and sends it through a series of relays which one by one "peels" back a layer, uncovering the data's next destination. After the final relay removes the final layer it sends it onto the site you are trying to access with no knowledge of who sent the message/request.</p>
							<h2>The History</h2>
							<p>Onion routing was originally developed in the mid-1990s at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory by Paul Syverson, Michael Reed, and David Goldschlag. It was originally made the protect U.S. intelligence communications online. In 2002 Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson joined Paul Syverson in 2002 to develop the largest best-known implementation of onion routing called 'The Onion Routing project' or the Tor Project.</p>
							<p>The main implementation of onion routing is in web browsing by using the Tor Browser. The Tor Browser is built off of a modification of the Firefox browser that changes default settings to be more privacy respecting. And as you can guess it sends all traffic through the Tor network. With this, your IP address is changed and websites can no longer use that to track you and it is much more anonymous than using a VPN as with one the VPN provider can still see what website you go to, with Tor exit nodes they can only see what websites a user is going to but not what user is accessing them. The major downside to Tor is the speed because your connection is being routed through several different nodes on different continents this means that the speed is much slower than a VPN.</p>
							<h2>How do you use Tor?</h2>
							<p>Firstly go to <a href="https://torproject.org/">https://torproject.org/</a> and download the Tor Browser for the platform you are on. Then install it... then launch it... the connect... then that's it. You can access the internet as normal in addition to Onion Sites/Hidden Services.</p>
							<h2>Are you completely Anonymous using Tor?</h2>
							<p>No, you are not. Tor cannot make you fully anonymous but some ways can help you. For example, go into the Tor Browser settings and then select the safest security option. This will disable some fonts/icons and Javascript. But why is that important?</p>
							<h3>Fingerprinting.</h3>
							<p>Not only your IP can be used to track you but the settings on your browser can be used to do this too. It is called browser fingerprinting and it is a technique of getting any piece of information from your browser however small that can link you between websites, that information might be how large your screen is, the Operating System you are using, the extensions installed on your web browser, the fonts installed on your computer and so much more. When using Tor Browser it masks everything for example saying that every user uses Windows and they use Firefox to make every user look the same so that fingerprinting is much harder. And by turning off Javascript most of the fingerprinting techniques can be avoided as the websites you are connecting to can no longer see the individual details that make you unique. There are several fingerprint testers online for example <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/</a>.</p>
							<h2>Isn't Tor illegal?</h2>
							<p>No... well, it depends. If you live in China then Tor is blocked meaning people in China cannot use the Tor Network however, this can be circumvented with Bridges. If you live in a place like the US or the UK then Tor is not illegal. But I know that you might be saying "isn't there illegal sites on Tor?". Yes, there are illegal sites on Tor just like there are Illegal sites on the Clear Web.</p>
							<h2>What is the difference between the Clear Web and a Hidden Service?</h2>
							<p>If you noticed when I was talking about how Tor works you saw that all the traffic was encrypted until it gets sent out to the website you are trying to access (the traffic is still being encrypted if the site is using HTTPS however if the site is using HTTP then the exit node can see the contents of whatever you are sending). So using Tor with the clear web can be dangerous, however what if the requests always stay inside the Tor network? Then it would always be encrypted until it gets to the website so not a single relay can see what content the traffic holds only you and the website you are accessing. This is what a Hidden Service is, a website that can only be accessed by Tor. They are also more commonly called Onion Sites. You can tell when you are on an onion site because the padlock in the upper right of the Tor Browser will become the Tor Browser logo and also the URL will look something like: <a id="yellow">http://ojdu6jltlecc5m24wtyou654frwyendjbkfqipp6tcgphgl53tjkqiyd.onion/</a>.</p>
							<p>Well, it won't look something like that... because it is exactly like that. That is my onion side. But why do I run an onion site? Because I believe that no one should be tracked and monitored on the internet and even though probably no one will care about the onion site because no one who cares about that would be reading this I still think it is important. Do I use Tor? Yes. For general internet browsing, I use the Tor Browser, however, for something more personal such as school work or Amazon. I would use another web browser like Firefox.</p>
							<p>Any that's just what I think. If you think any different or want to ask a question then contact me at my email <a id="yellow">contact@sevengames.xyz</a>. Make sure to encrypt it with my <a id="yellow" href="../../pgp.txt">PGP key</a> and send your PGP public key with the email.</p>
